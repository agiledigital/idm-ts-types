* TypeScript Support – Write your IDM JavaScript code in TypeScript which has modern language features while still being compatible with Rhino, the JavaScript engine that IDM uses.
* Type Safety – We've put together some TypeScript types that wrap the IDM API to ensure that all your calls to the API are type safe, plus you get the added benefit of getting type-ahead assistance from your IDE.
* Managed Object Type Generation – We've built a parser that can generate TypeScript types from your Managed Object types, this means that you can use your Managed Object types directly in TypeScript which enables IDE type-ahead assistance and type safety.
